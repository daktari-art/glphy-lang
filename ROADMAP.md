# Glyph Language Development Roadmap

## 🎯 Vision
Create the most intuitive visual data flow programming language that makes complex data transformations accessible to all developers.

## 🗓️ Phase 1: Foundation (Month 1)

### Week 1: Core Infrastructure
- [x] Language specification
- [x] GitHub repository setup
- [x] Basic project structure
- [ ] NPM package publishing

### Week 2: Parser & AST
- [ ] Advanced parser with proper error handling
- [ ] Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) definition
- [ ] Syntax validation
- [ ] Basic error recovery

### Week 3: Runtime Foundation
- [ ] Graph execution engine
- [ ] Node lifecycle management
- [ ] Basic data flow implementation
- [ ] Memory management

### Week 4: CLI & Tooling
- [ ] Command-line interface
- [ ] File watching and hot reload
- [ ] Basic debugging support
- [ ] First alpha release (v0.1.0)

## 🚀 Phase 2: Core Features (Month 2)

### Week 5-6: Type System
- [ ] Type inference engine
- [ ] Structural typing implementation
- [ ] Type validation
- [ ] Generic types support

### Week 7-8: Standard Library
- [ ] Math operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- [ ] Text processing functions
- [ ] List operations (map, filter, reduce)
- [ ] Basic I/O operations

## 💡 Phase 3: Advanced Features (Month 3)

### Week 9-10: Error Handling & Async
- [ ] Error as data flow implementation
- [ ] Async/await pattern for glyphs
- [ ] Promise integration
- [ ] Error recovery patterns

### Week 11-12: Visual Editor
- [ ] Web-based visual editor prototype
- [ ] Drag-and-drop node creation
- [ ] Real-time execution visualization
- [ ] Export to glyph code

## 🌟 Phase 4: Production Ready (Month 4+)

### Week 13-16: Performance & Optimization
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Memory usage optimization
- [ ] Parallel execution optimization
- [ ] Large graph handling

### Week 17-20: Ecosystem & Community
- [ ] Package manager for glyph libraries
- [ ] VS Code extension
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Tutorial series

## 🔮 Future Possibilities

### Machine Learning Integration
- [ ] Neural network as data flow graphs
- [ ] Tensor operations as glyph nodes
- [ ] Model training pipelines

### Distributed Computing
- [ ] Cluster execution mode
- [ ] Data partitioning across nodes
- [ ] Fault-tolerant execution
