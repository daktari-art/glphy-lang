# Glyph Language Development Roadmap

## 🎯 Vision
Create the most intuitive visual data flow programming language that makes complex data transformations accessible to all developers.

The goal is a language that is "Simple enough for a beginner, powerful enough for a pro."

## ✅ **COMPLETED - Phase 1: Foundation (v0.2.0)**

### ✅ Week 1-2: Core Infrastructure
- [x] Language specification v1.0
- [x] GitHub repository setup
- [x] Basic project structure
- [x] NPM package structure

### ✅ Week 3-4: Advanced Parser & AST
- [x] **Graph-based parser** with multi-input support
- [x] Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) with dependency tracking
- [x] Syntax validation and error recovery
- [x] Left/right arrow connection parsing

### ✅ Week 5-6: Runtime Foundation
- [x] **Graph execution engine** with topological sorting
- [x] Node lifecycle management
- [x] Multi-input data flow implementation
- [x] Memory management and execution history

### ✅ Week 7-8: CLI & Tooling
- [x] **Command-line interface** with multiple commands
- [x] **Interactive REPL** for real-time development
- [x] File watching and hot reload support
- [x] Comprehensive test suite
- [x] **v0.2.0 Production Release** 🎉

## ✅ **COMPLETED - Phase 2: Core Features (v0.3.0)**

### ✅ Week 9-10: Type System & Validation
- [x] **Type inference engine structure** - Initial static analysis implemented.
- [x] **Structural typing** placeholder implemented.
- [x] Runtime type validation stubs for future implementation.
- [x] Type error messages structure defined.

### ✅ Week 11-12: Standard Library Expansion & Core Engine Fixes
- [x] **Scoped Functions & Call Stack** - Function definition and recursion stubs integrated.
- [x] **Error Flow (⚡) Routing** - Engine logic for error data routing implemented.
- [x] **N-ary Arithmetic Fixes** - `subtract` and `divide` corrected to support multiple inputs (e.g., `a - b - c`).
- [x] **v0.3.0 Production Release** 🎉

## 🚀 **CURRENT - Phase 3: Modularity & Concurrency (v0.4.0)**

### 🔄 Week 13-14: Asynchronous Execution
- [ ] Implement **Async Scheduler** to manage `🔄 ASYNC_NODE`.
- [ ] Full support for `fetch`, file I/O, and database connections.
- [ ] Define best practices for handling asynchronous data flow.

### 🔄 Week 15-16: External Package System
- [ ] CLI command: `glyph install <package>`.
- [ ] Compiler logic for external function loading and linking.
- [ ] Registry format definition.

### 🔄 Week 17-18: Advanced Control Flow
- [ ] Pattern matching (`◯`) enhancements.
- [ ] Native support for `IF/ELSE` and `SWITCH` structures.

### 🎯 Goal: v0.4.0 Production Release
