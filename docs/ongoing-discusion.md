🎯 The Grand Vision: Glyph as a Complete Language

We need to map EVERY programming concept to the Glyph way:

🔄 Control Flow

```glyph
# IF/ELSE → Condition Nodes
[○ condition] → [◯ check] ─true─→ [▷ then_branch]
                        └false─→ [▷ else_branch]

# LOOPS → Loop Nodes with feedback
[⟳ loop] ← [◯ condition] → [▷ body] → [▷ update] → [⟳ loop]
```

🏗️ Data Structures

```glyph
# OBJECTS → Structured Data Nodes
[○ {name: "Alice", age: 30}] → [▷ get_field] ← [□ "name"] → [○ "Alice"]

# ARRAYS → List Nodes with operations
[△ [1, 2, 3]] → [▷ map] ← [▷ double] → [△ [2, 4, 6]]
```

🔧 Functions & Scope

```glyph
# FUNCTION DEFINITION
add_numbers:
  [⤵ a] → [⤵ b] → [▷ add] → [⤴ result]

# FUNCTION CALL  
[○ 5] → [▷ add_numbers] ← [○ 3] → [○ 8]
```

🛡️ Error Handling

```glyph
# TRY/CATCH → Error Flow
[○ input] → [▷ risky_operation] → [◯ success?] ─true─→ [○ result]
                                      └false─→ [⚡ error] → [▷ handle_error]
```

⚡ Async Operations

```glyph
# ASYNC/AWAIT → Async Nodes
[□ "data.json"] → [🔄 read_file] → [▷ parse_json] → [○ data]
```

🗺️ Comprehensive Feature Mapping

Let me create the complete taxonomy:

Traditional Concept Glyph Equivalent Status
Variables Data Nodes (○) ✅ Implemented
Strings Text Nodes (□) ✅ Implemented
Arrays List Nodes (△) ⚠️ Partial
Objects Structured Data 🚫 Missing
Functions Function Nodes (▷) ⚠️ Buggy
Conditionals Condition Nodes (◯) 🚫 Missing
Loops Loop Nodes (⟳) 🚫 Missing
Error Handling Error Nodes (⚡) 🚫 Missing
Async/Await Async Nodes (🔄) 🚫 Missing
Modules/Imports Subgraphs 🚫 Missing
Types Type Inference 🚫 Missing

🔍 Critical Analysis: What's REALLY Missing

1. EXECUTION MODEL 🚨

Current engine only does linear flow - we need graph evaluation:

```javascript
// NEED: Proper DAG execution
class GlyphScheduler {
    executeGraph(ast) {
        // 1. Build dependency graph
        // 2. Execute when inputs ready
        // 3. Handle parallel branches
    }
}
```

2. MEMORY MODEL 🚨

How do we handle state and mutation in an immutable system?

```glyph
# STATE MANAGEMENT → Feedback loops with cycle detection
[○ initial] → [⟳ accumulator] ← [▷ update] ← [○ new_value]
```

3. TYPE SYSTEM 🚨

```glyph
# TYPE ANNOTATIONS & CHECKS
[○ value] → [▷ assert_type] ← [□ "number"] → [◯ valid?] ─true─→ [○ validated]
```

🎯 The RIGHT Questions We Should Ask

Q1: How does Glyph handle MUTATION?

Traditional: x = x + 1
Glyph way:Create new data nodes with updated values

Q2: How does Glyph handle SIDE EFFECTS?

Traditional: Functions with side effects
Glyph way:Explicit output nodes and async flows

Q3: How does Glyph handle MODULARITY?

Traditional: Import/export modules
Glyph way:Reusable subgraphs and composition
